                    Perhaps the best argument for teaching the Bible to your
                    children - hey, get them out of the public schools fast! -
                    is the manifest blindness, blasphemy, and bigotry evidenced
                    by the World Herald editorial of July 24th, “Let There Be
                    Light The editorial is one of those rare object lessons that
                    parents would do well to clip from their paper. Then, they
                    can tell their children, “If you don’t read the Bible, you
                    will grow up to be this ignorant, and all the literate,
                    educated people in the world will laugh at you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is both surprising and instructive for us to realize that
                    this is the official position of the newspaper on both
                    evolution, and the Scriptures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blindness <br /> I say “blindness" advisedly, and it covers
                    both science and Bible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has historically been the case in the English-speaking
                    world– and still is – that a man ignorant of the Scriptures
                    is truly illiterate. The pretentious and high-minded tone of
                    the editorial only serves to heighten the embarrassment it
                    is to our entire community, insofar as the World herald is a
                    dominant and locally monopolistic print medium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, as anyone even slightly familiar with the subject
                    will tell you, "science" is the study of how things go on.
                    It involves the process of examination we call "empiricism",
                    and therefore is the compilation of assertions, facts, and
                    conclusions based on observation. One may not empirically
                    conclude about the origin of a thing by observing the way it
                    goes on. One may posit (hypothesize) how he thinks something
                    behaves, and then construct a theory of that behavior, but
                    in order for the theory to be accepted as valid, it must not
                    be contradicted EVER, and it must WORK. That is to say, one
                    must be able to take a theory, predict results, and with
                    them to persuade a qualified observer. Reproducing the
                    results consistently is one way to be persuasive.
                    Evolutionists have done none of that even to explain the way
                    things go on, let alone the impossible task of infering an
                    origin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take any simple item concerning which you may observe many
                    details, like your watch. You may observe the way it
                    functions, and assay all the elementary materials from which
                    is it composed. You may construct a hypothesis and a theory
                    that it moves uniformly in time, and even prove such a
                    theory. But from that information you cannot safely infer,
                    or come anywhere near accurately guessing the processes and
                    tooling used to manufacture it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the empirical method is not useful for inferring origins,
                    and the study of the origin of creation is not called
                    "evolution" but "cosmogony." It is comprised of all matter
                    of wild speculation, and is nowhere properly called science.
                    It was a pastime of speculative Jews and also of the ancient
                    Greeks, who, according to Paul the apostle, had nothing to
                    do but sit around on Mars Hill, and speculate concerning
                    some new thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cosmogony speculation was fundamental to the ancient
                    Gnosticism that crept in early to pollute Christianity, and
                    posed all manner of notions about aeons and endless
                    genealogies that were of no profit whatsoever. One may be
                    confident that in that system of lunacy, someone probably
                    suggested common - probably angelic - ancestors to men and
                    animals. Anything that will deny the bible truth that "in
                    the image of God created He him, male and female created He
                    them," is acceptable in such a system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, no scientist - even one despising the
                    Scriptures of God as the editorial author does - would
                    identify himself with the thought (or lack of it) that the
                    evolution discussion is about “solid science”. Even purely
                    secular thinkers - themselves willfully ignorant concerning
                    the creation - would not class “evolution” thus, even if
                    they mistakenly beloved it to be scientific enquiry at all.
                    And they certainly would not confuse “natural selection” -
                    which is science - with the “theory” of evolution. After
                    all, natural selection is a statistical scientific law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time and space would limit taking up the foolish discussion
                    the writer opens when he suggests that there does not need
                    to be evidence of intermediate forms of life connecting man
                    and the make-believe “theoretical” ancestor for the “theory”
                    to hold true, and yet claims “central to the case for
                    evolution is that it works over millions or billions of
                    years.” If the process is slow and imperceptible, then some
                    intermediate state of “ancestor” is only reasonable. But
                    forget that for a minute: What sort of science is it to say
                    “millions” or “billions” of years when one is at least a
                    thousand times more than the other? Don't we require
                    “science” to be a bit more precise than that? If Plancke’s
                    constant were variable by even a fraction, all matter would
                    collapse into itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, the W-H editorial writer is also completely ignorant
                    of what the Bible teaches, because he claims that those who
                    believe in the plenary verbal inspiration of Scripture
                    “insist that about 4,000 years ago, the Deity created human
                    beings and the rest of the world in six days - period.” Now,
                    I personally believe the Bible is the Word of God in
                    inspired form, fully, and verbally (which is to say it is
                    complete, and word-for-word). I have met with literally
                    scores of divergent views concerning the Bible, especially
                    the first chapter. But I have <b>NEVER</b> heard anyone who
                    reads the Bible at all - Christian, Jew, or atheist -
                    suggest that God created man 4,000 years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everything in the Bible would indicate that Abraham begat
                    Isaac roughly 4,000 years ago, and that is approximately 350
                    years after the deluge that Noah survived. The deluge is in
                    turn <b> MEASUREABLY </b> 1,656 years after Adam, according
                    to the Bible. “OK,” you might say, “So the guy makes a
                    mistake, and says 4,000 instead of 6,000.” He made that
                    mistake in front of hundreds of thousands of people and with
                    ample time to research it, and with ample opportunity to
                    edit it. A person so careless as this is likely playing fast
                    and loose with the other facts as well. And he is. Good
                    grief, not only do we have bad science, but <b> AWFUL </b>{' '}
                    Journalism!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bigotry <b />
                    In fact, the journalism is <b> SO BAD </b>, that one
                    suspects bigotry. And serious bigotry at that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The writer labels those who fault evolution “theory” as
                    faulty science as being liars, or those who do not
                    understand science at best. The very tone of the editorial
                    belies any sort of fairmindedness or even rational
                    discourse, and should be taken as a serious warning to be
                    vigilant concerning those who weild influence in our
                    commmunity, especially the Omaha World Herald.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The writer further misleads us greatly concerning the law of
                    our state in education. He may suggest that a well-rounded
                    economics student understands communism. But it is not
                    <b> LAW </b>
                    that a student does so. It is not a mandated piece of
                    elementary or secondary curriculum. Neither should the
                    teaching of evolution be a law, legislative or
                    administrative. (On the other hand, the teaching of the
                    fallacies of Nazism IS the law of our state, for instance,
                    but it isn't being taught.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is much more to be said here: concerning the issue of
                    our children's education, the courage of our Attorney
                    General, the manifest bigotry and hatred of Christian
                    thought exhibited continually by the World Herald editorial
                    editor. Underneath the tone, the false assertions, and the
                    bad science is the innuendo that those of us who belive the
                    literality, inerrancy, inspiration, and completeness of the
                    Scriptures are somehow unscientific buffoons. That is good
                    Marxist Leninism, but is still innacurate and ignorant.
                </p>

                    Perhaps we could observe the views of better men from a
                    better time:
                </p>
                <p>
                    William Gladstone, four times prime minister of Britain, and
                    perhaps the greatest legal mind in the English-speaking
                    world, said at the turn of the 19th century that he had
                    “been associated with sixty of the master minds of the
                    century, and all but five of the sixty were Christians.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Michael Faraday, perhaps the greatest empiricist of the 19th
                    century, and the man who is credited with laying the
                    foundations of classical field theory prior to our own civil
                    war said, “Why will people go astray when they have this
                    blessed book of God (the Bible) to guide them?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sir Isaac Newton, perhaps the greatest scientist in human
                    history, who, among other things, discovered the universal
                    law of gravitation, the composition of white light, particle
                    theory, and helped form the basis for modern quantum
                    mechanics, said: “If the Bible is true, the time is coming
                    when men shall travel at 50 miles an hour.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Blasphemy <b />
                    To top it off, the writer appropriates to himself Scripture
                    itself to headline his editorial. He is fortunate to live in
                    an ostensibly Christian nation (no thanks to him), because
                    such blashemy might cost him his life if he did such to,
                    say, the Koran. Of course it is Jesus Christ who died for
                    his sins, and not Mohammed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Voltaire, the French philosopher and leader of the so-called
                    enlightenment, commented cynically on Newton's Bible study,
                    and prediction, saying, ironically, “Poor Isaac. He was in
                    his dotage when he made that prophecy. It only shows what
                    Bible study will do to an otherwise scientific mind.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later, in his last breaths, Voltaire was said to have
                    screamed in terror into a Christless eternity, while his
                    dispossessed homestead became the house of a Bible printing
                    press.

        <h2 className={s.subtitle}>1st Corinthians 16</h2>
        <p>
          <span className={s.verseNum}>1</span> ¶ Now concerning the collection
          for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even
          so do ye.
          <br />
          <span className={s.verseNum}>2</span> Upon the first day of the week
          let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him,
          that there be no gatherings when I come.
          <br />
          <span className={s.verseNum}>3</span> And when I come, whomsoever ye
          shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your
          liberality unto Jerusalem. <br />
          <span className={s.verseNum}>4</span> And if it be meet that I go
          also, they shall go with me. <br />
          The words "collection" and "gatherings" above are the same word
          (logia) in the Scripture and the only time the word is used. It is a
          close relative for the word "logos" or "word" because it is the
          vehicle for commercial communications.
        </p>

        <p>In commerce, it's true that "money talks."</p>
        <p>
          It is not the case that there are no "money issues" with regard to the
          church. In fact, there are <b>VERY MANY</b> of them. Money is perhaps
          God's very favorite test.
        </p>
        <h2 className={s.subtitle}>Luke 16</h2>
        <p>
          <span className={s.verseNum}>11</span> If therefore ye have not been
          faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the
          true riches?
          <br />
          <span className={s.verseNum}>12</span> And if ye have not been
          faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which
          is your own?
          <br />
          <span className={s.verseNum}>13</span> No servant can serve two
          masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else
          he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God
          and mammon.
          <br />
          <span className={s.verseNum}>14</span> And the Pharisees also, who
          were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The principle is clear: the way money is handled will determine the
          way ministry of God's Word will go. Today, due to the unfaithful
          handling of money, many preachers - and therefore churches - simply go
          without the ministry of God's Word entirely because those "true
          riches" have not been entrusted to anyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, it is no surprise to discover that, in
          <span className={s.verseNum}>1st</span>
          Corinthians <span className={s.verseNum}>16</span>, the apostle Paul -
          who WAS entrusted with the true riches - goes well out of his way to
          make certain two arrangements. First, that each man lay aside his own
          giving according to his own circumstances - note well,
          <b> NOT</b> a tithe - so that
          <b> THERE IS NO PUBLIC COLLECTION</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's remarkable that so many, while alluding to this very passage,
          teach exactly the opposite of it's meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the apostle sees to it that he, a minister of the Word of God,
          is not handling the money of others destined for others so that he
          cannot be blamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rest assured that Pharisees to this day deride these things when they
          hear them.

                    There are three different phrases for “resurrection of the
                    dead” used in the King James Bible, and a careful review of
                    each of them will lead the serious Bible student to
                    “appreciate things that differ” and yield helpful results in
                    Bible understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These three phrases each offer progressive, further detail
                    as pertaining to the future state of those who believe in
                    Jesus Christ.

                <p>
                    “Resurrection” has such a strong connotation in the English
                    language, due to the influence of Christian thought, that it
                    immediately implies the return of the dead to life. In the
                    Greek language of the Bible, the word translated commonly to
                    “resurrection” is anastasis [Strong's #386][anastasis] and
                    denotes “standing up.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    In its common connotation in the Scriptures, the word always
                    references the future state of the dead, as they are brought
                    back to life, bodily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The context of “Resurrection” always has to do with “the
                    dead,” but the details of the word in its use can determine
                    “which dead” to which it is referring.

                    Resurrection #1: The General Resurrection: “OF the Dead.”
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first reference to “resurrection” in the New Testament
                    is in the context of the notable disbelief in the
                    resurrection of the body by the Sadducees:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Matthew <span className={s.verseNum}>22:23</span> The same
                    day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no
                    resurrection, and asked him ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    A great controversy inside Judaism at that time – and even
                    today – had to do with that which is invisible: whether in
                    space or time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sect of the Sadducees differed from the Pharisees in
                    that:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acts <span className={s.verseNum}>23:6</span>...the
                    Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel,
                    nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Sadducees were not merely passive disbelievers, but
                    actively hostile toward those who held the belief in a
                    bodily resurrection, especially, of course, after the Lord's
                    Own resurrection demonstrated the futility of their
                    disbelief.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acts <span className={s.verseNum}> 4:1 </span> And as they
                    spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the
                    temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 2 </span> Being grieved that
                    they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the
                    resurrection from the dead.
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 3 </span> And they laid hands
                    on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was
                    now eventide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Sadducees marked that group in Israel that was most
                    thoroughly “Hellenized” by the insidious Greek philosophies
                    that permeated the Roman empire. These philosophies –
                    gnostic, with their attendant stoic and epicurean practices
                    - later crept into the churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We get an inkling of this thinking when we observe Paul at
                    Mars Hill (the University of Athens at Mars Hill, as I like
                    to call it) remonstrating with the bigoted, arrogant - and
                    lazy - occupants of the Aereopagus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acts <span className={s.verseNum}>17:32</span> And when they
                    heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and
                    others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 33 </span> So Paul departed
                    from among them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But those Jews who had not departed from the faith held
                    firmly to the “resurrection of the dead” as a real hope to
                    be fulfilled at some uncertain future time. In fact, this
                    faith is referenced in:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hebrews <span className={s.verseNum}>6:1 </span> Therefore
                    leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go
                    on unto perfection;not laying again the foundation of
                    repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 2 </span> Of the doctrine of
                    baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of
                    the dead [ anastasewv te nekrwn ] , and of eternal judgment.
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 3 </span> And this will we do,
                    if God permit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The phrase, highlighted above, actually means “not
                    overthrowing” the foundation that is already in place. Part
                    of the doctrinal foundation in place in the faith, upon
                    which is built a doctrinal superstructure matching Christian
                    maturity is “the resurrection of the dead.”

                    Martha, the sister of Lazarus, demonstrated this
                    understanding in:
                </p>
                <p>
                    John <span className={s.verseNum}> 11:23 </span> Jesus saith
                    unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 24 </span> Martha saith unto
                    him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at
                    the last day. <span className={s.verseNum}> 25 </span> Jesus
                    said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
                    believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 26 </span>
                    And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
                    Believest thou this?
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 27 </span> She saith unto him,
                    Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of
                    God, which should come into the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Martha, as all devout and expectant Jews who received Christ
                    after his introduction by John the Baptist, had a
                    foundational understanding of the general resurrection, and
                    considered it to be once-for-all at “the last day.” The
                    apostles had the same understanding, but were in for some
                    further instruction.

                    were risen from the dead.

                    Holding a firm faith in and understanding of the general
                    resurrection, the apostles are taken by the Lord to the
                    Mount of Transfiguration. There is a great amount to be
                    learned in this episode, and it is significant that there is
                    a record of it in each of the gospel accounts.

                <p>
                    In the English version, we might not understand the
                    puzzlement of Peter James, and John in verse 10. And yet,
                    they DID wonder at what the Lord said when He referred to
                    his resurrection. And that is because He used a different
                    phrase, one perhaps lost on us if we are not careful
                    readers: “risen from the dead” [tou anyrwpou ek nekrwn].
                </p>
                <p>
                    What must have troubled them was the thought that
                    resurrection could occur “out from” the dead, leaving some
                    in the grave. This is not something they comprehended until
                    the Lord's resurrection made matters consummately plain:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Romans <span className={s.verseNum}> 1:3 </span> Concerning
                    his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of
                    David according to the flesh;
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 4 </span> And declared to be
                    the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of

                <p>
                    The Lord's resurrection began what is known in the New
                    Testament Scriptures as the “First” resurrection, on that
                    extends over a period of time and includes three groups of
                    believers at different times: Church of God, Jews, and
                    Gentiles. The Lord Jesus Christ is the first of the First
                    fruits of this resurrection.

                <p>
                    One of the more intriguing portions of Scripture is Paul's
                    proclamation:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Philippians <span className={s.verseNum}> 3:9 </span> And be
                    found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of
                    the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
                    righteousness which is of God by faith:
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 10 </span> That I may know
                    him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship
                    of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 11 </span> If by any means I
                    might attain unto the resurrection of the dead [thn
                    exanastasin twn nekrwn].
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 12 </span> Not as though I had
                    already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow
                    after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
                    apprehended of Christ Jesus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the context of this “first” resurrection, there is a
                    further delineation. We have to come to terms with Paul's
                    motivation here, and determine what his hope is, in
                    comparison to his assurance. We can be sure they are not the
                    same. So if we discover what he is assured of, at least we
                    can know what he DOESN'T mean when he says he wants to
                    attain this particular resurrection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, we can approach a discussion of this meaning in the
                    following manner:
                </p>
                <p>What exactly the apostle says.</p>
                <p>What he is already assured of.</p>
                <p>What is left for his attainment.</p>
                <p>
                    Many “problems” and difficulties” in the Scripture disappear
                    once we discover what the Scripture actually says. Due to
                    the prevalence of many popular misconceptions, it also helps
                    if we point out, at times, what the Scripture
                    <b> DOES NOT </b> say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the passage cited above, the apostle turns a phrase that
                    is nowhere else found in the Scripture. It is the phrase
                    “the out-resurrection from the dead.” This is something he
                    hopes to attain, and is something he has “not already
                    attained”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, due to his insecurity about his attainment, he
                    declares
                </p>
                <p>
                    Philippians <span className={s.verseNum}> 3:14 </span> I
                    press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of
                    God in Christ Jesus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The apostle <b> IS NOT </b> saying that he hopes to be
                    raised from the dead or that he hopes to attain to the first
                    resurrection. These are matters already clearly settled in
                    his faith.
                </p>

                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 1st </span> Corinthians
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 15:51 </span>
                    Behold, I shew you a mystery;We shall not all sleep, but we
                    shall all be changed,
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 52 </span> In a moment, in the
                    twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet
                    shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and
                    we shall be changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Did not suddenly become one insecure in his assurance of
                    participating in the very thing he taught others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The very language he uses in Philippians
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 3:11 </span> is that he hopes
                    for something different: he hopes to attain an
                    “out-resurrection” and it is related, not to the gift of God
                    – eternal life, with its necessary complement, the
                    resurrection from the dead – but to the prize of the high
                    calling of God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This prize is something to be “won” or attained. This does
                    not mean it is on a principle of works-for-wages, because
                    even a prize implies a gracious benefactor in the award.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, what is left for the attainment by the apostle is to be
                    “selected out” at the resurrection from the dead, wherein he
                    is assured to participate. In order to understand this
                    “selection,” it's important to consider what happens to
                    every believer in the resurrection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As <span className={s.verseNum}> 1st </span> Corinthians
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 15 </span>
                    above states, all Christian (Church of God) believers will
                    be taken in the first resurrection, some having not died,
                    but all being changed into having new glorified bodies. In
                    that moment – the twinkling of an eye – we will be
                    transported to the grand convocation known in Bible terms as
                    “the judgment seat of Christ.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 2nd </span> Corinthians
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 5: 8 </span>
                    We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent
                    from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 9 </span> Wherefore we labour,
                    that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 10 </span> For we must all
                    appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one
                    may receive the things done in his body, according to that
                    he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This scheduled rendezvous with Christ at His judgment seat
                    was the focal point of the apostle's life. It was also the
                    focal point of John the apostle's life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span className={s.verseNum}>1 </span> John
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 2:28 </span> And now, little
                    children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may
                    have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his
                    coming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 1 </span>John
                    <span className={s.verseNum}> 4:17 </span>Herein is our love
                    made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of
                    judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the one hope of the calling of every Christian. It
                    is the desire to hear from the Lord Jesus, “Well done,
                    though good and faithful servant, enter into the joy of thy
                    master.”
                </p>
                <p>It is the “out standing-up out from the dead.”</p>
                <p>It is the reason to lead an “outstanding” Christian life.</p>

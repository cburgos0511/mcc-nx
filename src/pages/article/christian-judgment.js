        <h2 className={s.subtitle}>The Judgment for Sin</h2>
        <p>
          Many people - even Christian people - think that the judgment for sins
          is yet future, and that all the scores will be settled in the
          by-and-by future when the Lord Jesus Christ returns. In so thinking,
          they obscure the great truth of the grand drama of redemption that
          took place, openly in the heavens, at Calvary's cross so many years
          ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          For sin was judged there:{" "}
          <i>
            "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
            might be made the righteousness of God in him."
          </i>
          <span className={s.verseNum}> (2 Cor. 5:21) </span> The Lord Jesus
          Christ, our Passover, was the burnt offering there, and he took the
          valid accusations away:{" "}
          <i>
            Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us,
            which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to
            his cross; And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a
            shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
          </i>
          <span className={s.verseNum}> (Col. 2:14) </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The great fact of judgment that is past is what confers release and
          peace to a believer in Jesus Christ. The Lord said, during his earthly
          ministry,{" "}
          <i>
            "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
            believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not
            come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life."
          </i>
          <span className={s.verseNum}> (John 5:24) </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the believer will not come into judgment for his sins, as
          that judgment is already passed, and therefore there is nothing
          anymore for the believer about the penalty for his sins, and the
          judgment of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, there is still the judgment of the believer himself as a
          believer, and servant of Jesus Christ.
        </p>

        <h2 className={s.subtitle}>Self Judgment</h2>
        <p>
          Today is therefore the day of self-judgment by Christians. As the
          Scriptures read{" "}
          <i>
            "For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when
            we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be
            condemned with the world."
          </i>
          <span className={s.verseNum}> (1st Cor 11:31-32) </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Christian is to be carefully discerning whether or not he is in
          faith, which is to say, whether he is not in sin. Romans 14:23 teaches
          that whatever does not proceed from faith is sin. If he has erred from
          faith, he discerns it, confesses the sin of it, having spoken to God
          about it according to the way that God sees it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, if he does not judge himself, he will be judged: at
          the judgment seat of Christ.
        </p>

        <h2 className={s.subtitle}>Judging Others in the Church</h2>
        <p>
          <i>
            But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that
            is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or
            a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not
            to eat. For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?
            do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without God
            judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked
            person.
          </i>
          <span className={s.verseNum}> (1 Cor 5:11-13) </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God:
            and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey
            not the gospel of God?
          </i>
          <span className={s.verseNum}> (1 Peter 4:17) </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The misapplication of "judge not lest you be judged" has done
          considerable damage in the churches of God, almost to the point where
          it is impossible to have a local church.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <span className={s.verseNum}>1</span> Cor
          <span className={s.verseNum}> 5</span>, it clearly says that, while
          the local church does NOT have anything to do with judging those on
          the outside, certainly there is to be judgment of those who will not
          judge themselves. Criteria are given for the most egregious sins which
          are five: fornication, covetousness, idolatry, railing, drunkenness,
          and extortion. When coupled with notoriety, the sinners committing
          them need to be "put away."
        </p>
        <h2 className={s.subtitle}>The Judgment Seat of Christ</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most overlooked truths in the Bible concerning Christians
          is the fact of a historical and geographical rendezvous of every
          believer with the Lord Jesus Christ personally at His judgment seat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the time of the judgment seat, the Bible gives only
          evidence that it is future to this present age, and on the other side
          of the grave. At the judgment seat of Christ, every Christian will be
          made evident to himself. Each Christian will carry away in his new
          glorified body at that time and from that place either evil or good
          that is deserved according to what we have done in our Christian
          lives.

                <h2 className={s.subtitle}>The Blasphemy of the Question.</h2>
                <p>
                    There has been a trend begun, implying (and sometimes coming
                    right out and saying) that the Christian life has to do with
                    asking oneself this allegedly spiritually-minded question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before examining the contra-biblical nature of this twisted
                    thought, perhaps we do well to examine the question itself
                    at face value. First off, why do those who portend to
                    profess the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior so easily refer to
                    Him as if he is a cab driver in Tijuana or a minor league
                    infield prospect playing in the winter leagues?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowhere in the Scriptures do we find the apostles or other
                    disciples referring to Him as other than "Lord." So what's
                    up with this commonly used first-name-basis for the Lord of
                    Glory and the King of the Heavens and Earth?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's up with it is <b> blasphemy</b>. So, it's no surprise
                    that what it ends up being is some new way to sell Christian
                    youth bracelets, watches, T-Shirts, and other paraphernalia
                    that actually work against the faith while making
                    merchandise (and merchandisers) of God's people.
                </p>

                <h2 className={s.subtitle}>The Futility of the Question.</h2>
                <p>
                    But it is not merely the surface features of the question -
                    and its casual treatment of the name of the Lord Jesus
                    Christ - that is the problem. The thought behind the
                    question is also a conception of ignorance AND presumption,
                    the very sort of people from which David sought to be
                    protected <span className={s.verseNum}> (Psalm 19:13)</span>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recommending to people that they should ask themselves this
                    question implies they know the answer. Almost always, they
                    do not. And when you examine the answers people
                    speculatively give, they are almost always in error about
                    what the Lord Jesus Christ DID do. What has resulted from
                    this "movement" (wind of doctrine) has been a new army of
                    people totally ignorant of the Scriptures blathering about
                    "I think Jesus would do this," or, "I'm sure Jesus would not
                    say that .."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure of this, the Lord Himself never commanded us to
                    regard our fallen selves as having His infallible Mind. It
                    is amazing how easily even Christians fail to recall that
                    the Lord Jesus Christ always
                    <i> knew all things at all times in his life</i>. They also
                    fail to recall that He is{' '}
                    <i> ever always very God of very God </i>
                    and thought and did what we could never imagine nor hope to
                    do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, in the face of 5,000 men (not to mention women
                    and children) what he would do and <b> DID </b>do is feed
                    them by miraculously multiplying food in their sight. The
                    Scriptures teach that we are His <b> FRIENDS </b> if we do
                    what He commands us to do, not if we do what we think He
                    would do.
                </p>

                <h2 className={s.subtitle}>The Arrogance of the Answer.</h2>
                <p>
                    Undaunted, those who seize this trite saying allow
                    themselves to speculate in their own thoughts, finding it
                    preferable to meditating on God through His Word. It's
                    arrogance, no doubt cloaked in self-attributed humility. But
                    it's easier (lazier) than studying the Scriptures to
                    discover what His commands are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because if one studies the Scripture, one would readily find
                    that the Lord Jesus Christ did not serve Himself, just as we
                    should not serve ourselves. However, Christians{' '}
                    <b> SHOULD </b> serve the Lord Jesus Christ, and our example
                    as a servant of Christ is the apostle Paul, the
                    proto-typical sinner. Therefore, often, the question is not
                    the one above, but "What would Paul do?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any case, the answer to what we should do is in the
                    Scriptures, not our own minds.
                </p>
                <h2 className={s.subtitle}>Humble Faith.</h2>
                <p>
                    Humble faith is what is required. Humble faith is neither
                    speculative, nor doubtful. It is assured and confident. The
                    humility is what leads someone to read the Scriptures, and
                    receive the instruction therein.
                </p>
                <h2 className={s.subtitle}>A Footnote.</h2>
                <p>
                    The writer of this brief exposition is now in Kenya, East
                    Africa. The country is littered with bracelets, tee shirts,
                    headbands, and hats with "WWJD" on them, having been sold to
                    a naive but otherwise spiritually hungry people. The
                    paraphernalia is especially spread among young people who,
                    if they saved their money, could buy a decent English
                    language Bible which would not mislead them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just like the screwballs (Paul Crouch, Benny Hinn, etc) on
                    TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network), this form of
                    "Christianity" is dealing true ministers of God's Word fits
                    here.

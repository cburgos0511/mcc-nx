            'The nostalgia of eating is my main ingredient. The smells that fill the house on Thanksgiving. Great Aunt Carolâ€™s late arrival with her apple pies in hand. My grandmother brewing a pot of decaf coffee. The way the buttery crust offsets the tart and gooey baked apples. The whole family together enjoying the ritual. Combined with a generous amount of European butter and sugar, this is what sustains my career.',

            'We hold that the Bible teaches that there is salvation from the penalty of all sins committed by anyone on the basis of the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ, only. The grace of God is God freely acting based on His Own Self, and therefore is not determined by the object of His love. The "gift of God is eternal life" and so eternal life is given by God.',
        verse:
            'For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.',
